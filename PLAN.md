# Migration Plan: thomwiggers.nl to Hugo Blox Tailwind

This document outlines the iterative migration of content from the old Hugo Blox Bootstrap site to the new Tailwind-based site.

## Goals
- Migrate all content (posts, publications, events, etc.)
- Ensure the site builds correctly at every step.
- Maintain project conventions and style.
- Commit after each successful step.

## Strategy
1. **Initial Setup**: Create this plan and verify the base template builds.
2. **Author Profile**: Migrate `content/authors/thom/`.
3. **Configuration**: Carefully merge settings from `config/_default/params.yaml`, `languages.yaml`, `menus.yaml`, etc.
4. **Publications**: Migrate `content/publication/`.
5. **Posts**: Migrate `content/post/`.
6. **Events**: Migrate `content/event/`.
7. **Projects**: Migrate `content/project/`.
8. **Teaching**: Migrate `content/teaching/`.
9. **Custom Layouts/Assets**: If any, migrate or adapt them.
10. **Final Review**: Ensure all links work and the design is consistent.
