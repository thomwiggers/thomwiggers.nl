<p>It's been a while since I posted. Today I decided it was time to behave
myself a bit like the pretentious hipster I secretly am and post a bit about
the music that I discovered lately.</p>

<h4>London Grammar - If You Wait (2013)</h4>

    <p>London Grammar are an UK based indie pop band. They released their debut
    album <em>If You Wait</em> a couple of weeks ago. <a title="Pitchfork Review"
      href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18473-london-grammar-if-you-wait/"
      target="_blank"><em>Pitchfork</em> already wrote a great review about them</a>,
    so I'm not going to repeat that, but I'd like to highlight their great cover of
    Kavinsky's Nightcall, capturing the feeling of the original track so
    nicely.</p>

<h4>Kill Paris - The Beginning (2012)</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-8 columns">
    <p>Kill Paris's tracks are a strange bunch. Electronic masterpieces, having influences of dubstep, indie electro and UK Garage. The tracks remind you of several popular and less popular pieces of music, but done in such a way that it's brand new and just makes you want to dance.</p>

<h4>Arcade Fire - The Suburbs (2010)</h4>

    <p>An album which I completely missed back when it was released. Grammy winner (which led to <a title="Who Is Arcade Fire???!!? Tumblr" href="http://whoisarcadefire.tumblr.com/post/3305518760" target="_blank">hilarious reactions</a>) and overal awesome release. I particularly like the album's second track, <em>Ready To Start</em>.</p>
    <p>Arcade Fire is releasing a new album soon called <em>Reflektor.</em> It's title track <em>Reflektor</em> has already been released and is also a great way to start your day.</p>

<h4>CHVRCHES - The Bones of What You Believe (2013)</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-8 columns">

    <p>Great, happy indie pop. The band picked this name because you wouldn't
    be able to find them in Google's search engine if they'd be named
    "Churches". This is their first album. Great stuff to listen to if you're
    in a happy, uncomplicated mood.</p>
