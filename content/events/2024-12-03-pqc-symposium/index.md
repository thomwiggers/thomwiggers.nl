  country: The Netherlands
summary: |
  In this talk, I explain that although the focus on and progress with post-quantum key exchange is great, that does not mean that we should relax about post-quantum authentication. Post-quantum authentication is going to be hard and expensive (in most importantly bandwidth), and this will likely remain the case.
