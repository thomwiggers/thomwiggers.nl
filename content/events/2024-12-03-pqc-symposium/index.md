title: "How are we going to afford post-quantum authentication?"
event: PQC Symposium
event_url: https://post-quantum.nl/episode7.html
location: Amare
address:
  street: Spuiplein 150
  city: Den Haag
  region:
  postcode: 2511 EN
  country: The Netherlands
summary: >
  In this talk, I explain that although the focus on and progress with
  post-quantum key exchange is great, that does not mean that we should
  relax about post-quantum authentication. Post-quantum authentication
  is going to be hard and expensive (in most importantly bandwidth), and
  this will likely remain the case.
