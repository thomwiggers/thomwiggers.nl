summary: Talk about KEMTLS on Cloudflare TV
abstract: |
  The Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) is a protocol that secures most of
  the Internet connections, but it is also one that will be broken when quantum
  adversaries arrive.
  Sofía and Thom will talk about a new proposed mechanism,
  KEMTLS, for making the TLS protocol safe for quantum computers.
