In July, Peter Schwabe, who supervised my Bachelor's thesis project, suggested
to submit my work to the [Student Research Conference][src]. It then turned out
that the deadline was the next day, so I had to work hard to convert 28 pages
of thesis into a paper of 4 pages.

To my own suprise my paper was accepted for a poster presentation. It was very
interesting and challenging to tell the people at the conference (which was at
Tilburg University) about my research: I had a very technical story, and a lot
of people in the humanities already are scared by the word "encryption".
Nevertheless it was a nice experience and I think I was able to get at least
some things through to people.

I've updated my [Prøst page][proest] with the published paper and the poster
I presented.
