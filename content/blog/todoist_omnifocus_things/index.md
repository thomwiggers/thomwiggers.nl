I've been playing with various task managers / personal life management tools.
These are some of my notes and thoughts.

## Todoist review

**Pro:**

* Filters (custom perspectives)
* Smart task editor when adding tasks
* Great web interface and decent mobile apps
* Super flexible recurrence (“every third…”)

**Cons:**

* No review: discovering stale tasks is fairly low
* No way of marking tasks as “ready” or “available” unless you go into filters
  and tags religiously
* No postponing/deferring of tasks
* No scheduling of tasks

## Omnifocus review

**Pro:**

* Projects and subprojects
* Tasks and subtasks
* Deferring of tasks until date
* “Waiting” tag to mark tasks as currently unavailable
* Built-in Review
* Custom perspectives (pro version)
* Projects and tasks can be marked as “parallel” or “sequential” so that only
  one tag is “ready”
* Possible to create views with tasks that are currently ready to pick up

**Cons:**

* Mac only
* Pricy (10/m, 99/y or pricy app one-time purchases (major version upgrades extra))
* No/crappy and expensive (subscription) web interface
  * edit: It works reasonably okay, it's just not as slick in terms of UX as the competition's
* Not extremely flexible recurrence like Todoist
* Interface is quite click-heavy (maybe I don’t know the shortcuts yet) – missing
  Todoist’s quick-entry with “@foo +foo due:date” inline
* Tags are all the same colour
* Edit: synchronizing between the various clients is _quite_ slow.
  Sometimes it just breaks and you're starting at the app for a few minutes.

## Things review (Things on Mac)

I've not played with Things for as long.
I've quickly realised that it's mainly a lot like Todoist.

**Pro:**

* Simple and clean look
* Areas and projects (which are tasks)
* Subtasks
* Scheduling ability

**Con:**

* Mac only
* No web interface
* Pricy (desktop: 50, ipad: 20, iphone: 10)
* No deferring of tasks
* No blocking of tasks as “unavailable”
* No review option built-in
* No subprojects; projects are intended to be completable
* No custom perspectives / filters
